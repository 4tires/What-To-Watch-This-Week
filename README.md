## Changelog

### v2

- Added Round
- Added Leg
- Added Aggregate

### v3

- Created two spreadsheets, one for input - to fill in the data - and another for output - to make the necessary process.

### v4

- Removed the aggregate column to become: Team A (2) vs (3) Team B

### v5

- Added Sprites

#### v5.1

- Added Sprites with official (standart) names to promote coherency and avoid spelling mistakes

### v6

- Added italic instead of just bold
- Added a circle (button) to clear only a few cells instead of all cells

### v7

- Removed italic
- Tried to change to excel (dropdown list search was bad even with add-in)
- Created a new spreadsheet to have all days of the week and tidy the sheets / formula to improve workflow								

### v8

- Use App Scripts to integrate all days and give a single text to copy

### v9

- Use Selenium to automate the fetching of the data (Still needs manual correcting because of differing linguistic terms e.g. Bayern Munich != Bayern Munch)
- Use vlookup to help with CL and EL groups

## Backlog

- Create python dictionary to remove manual correction of team and league names (Linguistic differences as stated in v9) maybe use pickle for performance reasons
- Add automatic leg score
- Install Grid (needs Docker) to use python in spreadsheets easily
- (Hard) Automate round and group letter of the competition (e.g. "Semi-Final"; "Group B") as stated in v9
- Maybe ditch the spreadsheets (probably hard because of bold matches)
- Add more flairs (maybe use https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/f8z3sc/what_to_watch_this_week_241_march/fioh87b/)
